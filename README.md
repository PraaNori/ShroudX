# 🕶️ ShroudX — Web-Based Steganography Application

**ShroudX** is a web application based on steganography that enables secure data hiding through multiple innovative techniques.  
The project focuses on privacy, simplicity, and practical usability, combining software engineering principles with real-world secure communication needs.

---

## 📘 Introduction

**ShroudX** allows users to hide secret data within various types of files using steganographic techniques.  
It supports multiple data-hiding methods:

- **Image-in-Image**
- **Text-in-Image**
- **Text-in-Text**
- **Audio-in-Image**

The goal of the project is to ensure secure information sharing without relying on third-party storage or cloud services, while maintaining ease of use and accessibility.
